    "Iterators: In Python, an iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods: __iter__() and __next__(). The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next item from the iterator. Iterators provide a way to iterate over a sequence of elements, fetching one element at a time.\n",

    "Generators: A generator is a special type of iterator that is created using a generator function or a generator comprehension. Generator functions are defined like regular functions but use the yield keyword instead of return to produce a series of values. Each time the yield statement is encountered, the generator function suspends its execution, saves its internal state, and yields the value to the caller. The next time the generator is called, it resumes execution from where it left off, retaining its internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship: Generators can be seen as a concise and convenient way to create iterators. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator. The generator object can be iterated over using a loop or by calling the next() function on it. The generator function's code is executed on each iteration until a yield statement is encountered. At that point, the yielded value is returned, and the function's state is saved. The next time the generator is iterated, execution resumes from where it left off, continuing until the next yield statement or until the function completes."
